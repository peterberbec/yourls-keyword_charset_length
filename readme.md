#Hexadecimal Keywords


Plugin for [YOURLS](http://yourls.org) `Only tested on 1.7`

Description
-----------
Changes the sequential keywords from base36 to base16. That's it. In other words, the characters available are 0-9, and a-f, in that order, rolling over at f.

*Untested with base 62. I would assume that it will simply break completely, let me know if it doesn't.*

Installation
------------
1. In `/user/plugins`, create a new folder named `hexdec`.
2. Drop these files in that directory.
3. Go to the Plugins administration page ( *eg* `http://sho.rt/admin/plugins.php` ) and activate the plugin.
4. Have fun!

License
-------
YOURLS' license, aka *"Do whatever the hell you want with it"*.
